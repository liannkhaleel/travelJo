If you're looking to experience authentic Jordanian culture and enjoy a relaxing holiday by the beach, Aqaba is the place for you. Aqaba is a small port city located in southern Jordan on the Gulf of Aqaba with beautiful sandy beaches decorated with palm trees and a panoramic view of the mountains. Like the Dead Sea and Ma'in hot springs, there are a number of options for hotels and resorts that offer direct access to the beach as well as many activities like water sports (wind surfing, surfing, tubing, snorkeling, etc.) as well as food tours and in-hotel activities (mainly spa). </p>
