<p class="main-text">
Nestled deep in Jordan's southwestern desert is the archeological site Petra. Petra happens to be one of the seven wonders of the world, and its classfication definitely suits the beauty that it has to offer. I remember the first time that I visited Petra, I was amazed at the intricacy of the architecture combined with the traces of natural factors that left their mark on the site. It would be best for any prospective travellers to join a tour rather than venture on their own as it pretty easy to get lost. The travel guides are very informative
