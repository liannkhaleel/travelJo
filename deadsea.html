<p class="main-text">
Breathtaking and unusual nature - that is what embodies the natural scene in Jordan. Many people abroad know about the Dead Sea. In essence, it is a very salty and healing reservoir. This reservoir is located in a valley that extends between the mountains of Moath and Judah. This wonder is more than 400 m below sea level. In fact, this is not even a sea, but a large lake that has no outlet to the ocean, only fed by the Jordan river and mineral springs. You can visit one of the few resorts placed along the coast which have wonderful programs and internal activities for those visiting such as the spa, tours, and "private" access to the dead sea itself. </p>
